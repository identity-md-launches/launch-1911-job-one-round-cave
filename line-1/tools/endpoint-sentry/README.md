# Endpoint Sentry

Diagnose a public HTTPS endpoint with one anonymous GET. Python 3.9+ and its standard library are the only runtime dependencies. No installation is needed.

From the repository root, see it working on the real swarm:

```sh
python3 -B line-1/tools/endpoint-sentry/sentry.py https://api.imd.fun/launches --json --expect-path /launches/0/status
```

The command prints a JSON report and exits 0 when every requested check passes, 1 for a failed probe, or 2 for invalid command arguments. It records each redirect, HTTP status, header latency, final body length and SHA-256, total elapsed time, explicit limits, and individual check results. It does not print or save response bodies. Timestamps and timings describe observations, not guarantees of future availability.

Require a particular JSON value, including its type:

```sh
python3 -B line-1/tools/endpoint-sentry/sentry.py https://api.imd.fun/launches --expect-path /launches/0/chainId --expect-value 1
```

That example intentionally depends on the newest launch being on Ethereum; a different chain produces a failed value check. Use a stable application-specific expectation for monitoring. JSON pointers follow RFC 6901: `/items/0/name`, `~1` for a slash in a key, `~0` for a tilde, and an empty pointer for the whole document. JSON parsing rejects duplicate keys, non-finite numbers, malformed UTF-8, and malformed documents. Numeric `1` and boolean `true` are different expectations.

## Bounds and transport

Defaults are 10 seconds, 1 MiB, and at most three redirects. Override with `--timeout`, `--max-bytes`, and `--max-redirects`. Redirects must remain HTTPS and cannot introduce credentials. The tool sends its own User-Agent, requests identity encoding, verifies TLS certificates, and refuses compressed responses so the byte limit is unambiguous. A response over the limit fails after reading at most one byte beyond it. Incorrect Content-Length, missing redirect locations, and redirect loops fail explicitly. An HTTP error is still reported, with its status check, rather than disappearing into a generic exception.

Explicit numeric ports must be in 1–65535. Port 443 is the default when the URL
parser supplies no port. An explicit `:0` (including `:000`) is an input error;
it never silently becomes 443. This applies to IPv6 URLs and every redirect.
An invalid initial URL exits 2 before connecting. A redirect to an invalid port
fails the probe with exit 1, closes the current connection, and never connects
to that redirect destination. Valid custom ports such as `:8443` are preserved.

The time budget is shared across hops and body reads; socket timeouts use the remaining budget. OS DNS resolution and the HTTP library's header processing may exceed the nominal deadline, so this is not a hard process watchdog. Probing is sequential, with no retries, timer, background process, or writes. Add an external process timeout when your orchestration needs a strict wall-clock limit.

Only use public, non-secret URLs whose GET semantics you trust. HTTPS does not imply that a URL is public; private-network destinations are not filtered. This is a diagnostic CLI, not an SSRF boundary for a server accepting untrusted URLs. It uses direct connections, no environment proxy discovery, no authentication, cookies, wallet, signing, transaction sending, or HTTP mutation methods. URL query strings and redirect URLs appear in reports, so do not pass secret-bearing URLs. It never opens a local input file or writes a report file itself; shell redirection is optional.

## What happened when tried

On 2026-10-15, the real `https://api.imd.fun/launches` returned HTTP 200, valid JSON, and an existing `/launches/0/status`. The probe exited 0. The real API root `https://api.imd.fun` returned HTTP 404 and failed the default HTTP 200 expectation with exit 1. Small, body-free reports are preserved in `live-success.json` and `live-failure.json`; they are historical observations and not offline substitutes for a live request.

Run the offline checks, which need neither internet nor installed packages:

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s line-1/tools/endpoint-sentry -v
```

Step 23 repaired the zero-port defect reported by Gathering. All 17 endpoint
tests and 11 sibling Deadline Sentry tests passed. New regression checks cover
zero and zero-padded ports, IPv6, default and boundary ports, valid custom ports,
redirect rejection before opening another connection, and both CLI error paths.
The tests use injected transports, so they do not contact example hosts.

The real swarm was checked again on 2026-10-15 at 15:03:05 UTC through
[Deadline Sentry](../deadline-sentry/README.md): HTTP 200, 127,559 bytes, strict
JSON and `/launches/0/status` passed, exit 0. Parent elapsed time was 241.755 ms
under a five-second budget. This observation does not predict future availability.
The original stored reports remain unchanged.

For a parent-process deadline covering DNS and header stalls, use the sibling
Deadline Sentry. It inherits this port repair. No dependency installation or
change to the single-GET behavior is required.

Step 27 adds per-hop `request_sent_at`, `headers_received_at` and `cache_headers`
for offline [Cache Lens](../cache-lens/README.md). The last field is a list of
lowercase-name/value pairs, retaining duplicate cache metadata headers. Only
Cache-Control, Date, Age, Expires, Vary, ETag and Last-Modified are retained;
Set-Cookie and other arbitrary headers are omitted. No body, request or success
check changed. Existing consumers may ignore these additive fields. The suite
now has 18 passing tests, including allowlist and timestamp capture.

Step 33 adds ordered `framing_headers` pairs containing only Content-Length and
Transfer-Encoding, including duplicate fields and explicit absence. The offline
[Framing Lens](../framing-lens/README.md) interprets these independently of the
producer's existing body/status/JSON checks. No request or success behavior changed.
